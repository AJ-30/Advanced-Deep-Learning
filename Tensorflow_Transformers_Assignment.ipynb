        "This tutorial demonstrates how to build a transformer model and most of its components *from scratch* using low-level TensorFlow and Keras functionalities. Some of this could be minimized if you took advantage of built-in APIs like `tf.keras.layers.MultiHeadAttention`.\n",

        "The core idea behind a transformer model is *self-attention*—the ability to attend to different positions of the input sequence to compute a representation of that sequence. Transformer creates stacks of self-attention layers and is explained below in the sections *Scaled dot product attention* and *Multi-head attention*.\n",
